          <h1>What makes a good dinner spot?</h1>

          <p>
            My interest in food really stems from my mom's and I’s adventures
            trying restaurants when on vacation. Dinners were always a focal
            part of our stay, which got planned many weeks in advance, so dinner
            stops are important to me. When looking for a good dinner spot,
            there are several things I consider. I look at service, obviously
            taste, ambiance, and the strength of their dessert menu. I also like
            diversity, so my list includes some more fancy options for special
            occasions as well as casual stops. It's all about balance, as they
            say.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of service, that is essential when evaluating a dinner
            restaurant. I love a place that not only makes you feel like a
            valued patron but also a friend. My mom and I recently went to
            Birdie’s when she was in town, and they chatted about Phish and the
            Grateful Dead with her as if she were a regular, despite her living
            in Georgia and only visiting on occasion. Service kind of goes along
            with ambiance. I want a curated vibe that makes me feel comfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taste is an obvious one. I am not putting anyone on here who I think
            makes bad food. However, as someone who always opts for dessert, I
            am looking for a strong and innovative dessert menu (if offered). I
            want to feel like dessert is not an afterthought, because sometimes
            it's the best part of my meal. For example, Uchi’s chocolate bar
            dessert never disappoints or feels like it misses the mark, even
            after the wonderful meal.
          </p>

          <p>
            I always look for restaurants that have a solid outdoor option.
            Austin in the spring and fall is some of my favorite times of the
            year, and I love the option to eat outside and enjoy the warmer
            weather.

                great, get some appetizers too. If you go on a weekend, get
                there early to avoid long lines.
