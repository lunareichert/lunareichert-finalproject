        <h1>What makes a good dinner spot?</h1>
        

  
    
<p>My interest in food really stems from my mom's and I’s adventures trying restaurants when on vacation. Dinners were always a focal part of our stay, which got planned many weeks in advance, so dinner stops are important to me. When looking for a good dinner spot, there are several things I consider. I look at service, obviously taste, ambiance, and the strength of their dessert menu. I also like diversity, so my list includes some more fancy options for special occasions as well as casual stops. It's all about balance, as they say.</p>

  

  
    
<p>In terms of service, that is essential when evaluating a dinner restaurant. I love a place that not only makes you feel like a valued patron but also a friend. My mom and I recently went to Birdie’s when she was in town, and they chatted about Phish and the Grateful Dead with her as if she were a regular, despite her living in Georgia and only visiting on occasion. Service kind of goes along with ambiance. I want a curated vibe that makes me feel comfortable.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Taste is an obvious one. I am not putting anyone on here who I think makes bad food. However, as someone who always opts for dessert, I am looking for a strong and innovative dessert menu (if offered). I want to feel like dessert is not an afterthought, because sometimes it's the best part of my meal. For example, Uchi’s chocolate bar dessert never disappoints or feels like it misses the mark, even after the wonderful meal.</p>

  

  
    
<p>I always look for restaurants that have a solid outdoor option. Austin in the spring and fall is some of my favorite times of the year, and I love the option to eat outside and enjoy the warmer weather.</p>
